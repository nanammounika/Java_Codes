Corn IRA set:

Create a class Corn with the below attributes:
cornType - String
cornName - String
protein(in grams) - double
price - int
The above attributes should be private. Wtrite getter, setter and parameterized constructor as required.
Create class Solution with main method.

Implement two static methods-
averageProteinByType and sortCornByPrice in Solution class.
averageProteinByType method:
This method will take an array of Corn objects and a String values as input parameters.The method will find out average protein for given Corn Type(String parameter passed).
This method will return average protein if found. If there is no Corn that matches then the method should return 0.0
sortCornByPrice method:
This method will take an array of Corn objects and a int value as input parameters.This method should return array of Corn objects in an ascending order of their price
which are less than the given price(int parameter passed).If there is no such Corn,  then the method should return null.

Note: No two Corn objects would have same price and name.Search should be case insensitive.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.
For averageProteinByType method - The main method should print the average protein, if the returned value is not 0.0. 
Else, it should print "There is no such Corn available.".
For sortCornByPrice method - The main method should print the CornName from the returned Corn object arrary if the returned value is not null. 
If the returned value is null, then it should print "No Corn found.".
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Corn objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
Next, read the value for String parameter and int parameter for capturing Corn Type and price respectively.
